    <p>Hello everyone, It's nice to meet you.</p>
    <p> I'll tell you a little about myself.
        I am from Quito, Ecuador. In my city, I study Information Technology engineering; on the other hand, I also study Software Development at BYU.</p>
    </p>My hobbies are painting and singing. I am also looking to improve my programming skills during my free time and more.
        My favorite passage is found in James 1:5. It really helps me understand my purpose as a child of God and how He constantly helps me.
        I am a student and serve in the church; I have been a member of it for ten years.<p>
    </p>My life plan includes, in the future, getting married in the Temple and having an eternal family with my boyfriend.
        I hope everyone is very happy about choosing the right thing for their life, Thank you for reading</p>
