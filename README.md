# About Me
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Gabriela Rivera, and I'm a 20-year-old student, I'm currently enrolled in the BYU Pathway program. 
While I find joy in various forms of art, such as painting, drawing, and singing, my true passion lies in the realm of technology and web development.
# Academic Journey
I am immersed in my academic journey, pursuing a degree in Web and Software Development. 
Programming is not just my field of study; it's my fascination! I relish every moment 
spent creating innovative solutions and bringing new ideas to life through code.
